###  Project Objective**

The primary goal is to develop an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that offers a holistic view of IPL data across multiple dimensions:

* **Match-Level Insights**: Analyze toss decisions, margins of victory, and high-scoring encounters.
* **Player Performance**: Track top run-scorers (Orange Cap), wicket-takers (Purple Cap), and power hitters (most sixes and fours).
* **Team Analysis**: Examine seasonal trends, team consistency, and home vs. away performances.

This project aims to empower fans, analysts, and teams with a data-driven understanding of the game.

###  Dataset Information**

The analysis is built on two comprehensive datasets sourced from IPL historical records:

* `matches.csv`: Contains match-level data such as team names, venues, dates, match results, and toss decisions.
* `deliveries.csv`: Includes detailed ball-by-ball data covering runs, wickets, player names, and delivery outcomes.

Combining these datasets enables both high-level summaries and granular insights.

---

###  Methodology and Tools**

* **Data Integration**: Cleaned and merged `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv` to create a single, structured dataset.
* **Data Visualization**: Designed interactive dashboards using **Tableau**, emphasizing user-friendly design and flexibility.
* **Analytical Approach**: Focused on multi-layered insights—from individual player metrics to team strategies over time.

 **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covers performance at the **match**, **player**, and **team** levels.
 **Trend Discovery**: Identifies actionable trends, such as performance consistency, toss impacts, and powerplay strategies.
